# SF Muni
This is a simple React app that showcases the power of [D3](https://d3js.org/) to render geographic data. In this case specifically the SF map is rendered along with live SF Muni vehicle locations retrieved from the [NextBus Public XML Feed](https://www.nextbus.com/xmlFeedDocs/NextBusXMLFeed.pdf).
